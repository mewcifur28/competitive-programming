/*
Mike is a very passionate about sets. Lately, he is busy solving one of the problems on sets. He has to find whether if the sum of any of the non-empty subsets of the set A is zero.

Input Format
The first line contains an integer T, which is the total number of test cases.
T test cases follow.
Each test case consists of two lines.
The first line consists of a single integer N, which is the number of elements present in the set A.
The second line contains N space separated integers denoting the elements of the set A.

Constraints
1 ≤ T ≤10
1 ≤ N ≤ 4
-10^5 ≤ A[i] ≤ 10^5

Output Format
Print the answer for each testcase in a new line.
If the sum of any of the subset is zero, then print “Yes” (without quotes) else print “No”(without quotes).

Sample Input
1
4
1 3 2 -3
Sample Output
Yes
Explanation
The sum of the subset {3,-3} is zero.
